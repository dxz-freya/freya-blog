## Introduction

During my master's program, I independently developed a fully functional **Library Management System**. This project was not only an academic assignment but also a practical showcase of my full-stack development capabilities.

I designed and implemented the system from scratch, covering the **entire software development lifecycle**: requirement analysis, architecture design, front-end implementation, back-end logic, database design, and deployment.

The system provides **secure authentication**, **role-based access control**, an intuitive **admin dashboard**, and rich **self-service features** for library users, enabling the **digital management of a modern library**.

## Technology Stack

- **Architecture:** MVC pattern, separating business logic, data, and presentation layers for better organization and testability.
- **Backend Framework:** ASP.NET Core with C# as the primary language.
- **Database:** SQLite, storing all structured data.
- **Frontend:** Razor Pages, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap – responsive and mobile-friendly interfaces.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** ASP.NET Core Identity – customizable user and role management, secure login system.

## Core Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Fine-grained permissions – administrators can manage users and books, while regular users can borrow, return, and view borrowing history.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Inventory management, author management, user management, and reporting tools.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive pages for searching books, viewing borrowing records, tracking due dates, and more.
- **Business Logic Automation:** Automatic calculation of borrowing periods, overdue detection, book availability checks, and real-time inventory updates.

## Highlights & Achievements

- **Full-Stack Development:** Independently implemented the entire project from front-end to database, demonstrating end-to-end engineering skills.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Applied OOP principles to create clear, maintainable, and extensible data models and business logic.
- **Complex Business Rules:** Successfully handled real-world library operations, including inventory synchronization, overdue handling, and borrowing rules.
- **Scalable & Robust Architecture:** Designed MVC-based architecture with a clean separation of concerns for easier future enhancements.
- **Professional-Grade Features:** Secure authentication, role-based authorization, and responsive UI for mobile and desktop users.

> This Library Management System is more than a course project—it is a **full-stack engineering portfolio piece**. It demonstrates my ability to **translate complex requirements into a reliable, functional, and well-architected application**.
