## Introduction

**Haunted House Game** is a 3D puzzle-adventure game that I independently developed. Players assume the role of **John Lemon**, navigating a haunted mansion filled with ghosts and traps, using stealth, puzzle-solving, and strategic thinking to complete challenges.

This project was fully conceptualized and implemented by me, blending **game design, technical development, and visual arts**, and showcasing my **full-stack game development capabilities**.

## Technology Stack

- **Game Engine:** Unity
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Architecture:** Component-Based Modular Architecture, enabling high extensibility and code reuse
- **Art & Modeling:** Blender for 3D modeling; integrated materials and scenes using Unity’s tools
- **UI/UX Design:** Designed intuitive user interfaces and interaction flows to ensure smooth gameplay and consistent visual style

## Core Features

- **Character Control:** Smooth third-person movement, jumping, and environment interaction.
- **Ghost AI & Trap Systems:** Multi-mode ghost behavior including patrol, chase, and search, dynamically triggered by in-game events.
- **Progressive Level Design:** Multiple themed levels with increasing difficulty, gradually guiding players to master game mechanics.

## Highlights & Achievements

- **Immersive Visual Design:** Leveraging my background in advertising and design, I independently defined the game’s visual style and created art assets, establishing a unique aesthetic combining eerie and humorous elements.
- **Modular System Architecture:** Component-based design allows flexible reuse and extension of AI behaviors, trap logic, and other game mechanics, significantly improving development efficiency.
- **End-to-End Game Development:** Covered the full development pipeline from concept art, Blender modeling, Unity integration, gameplay programming, to final testing and release, demonstrating comprehensive capabilities.
- **User-Centered Experience:** Applied UI/UX expertise to create intuitive, responsive interfaces, ensuring a comfortable and engaging player experience.
