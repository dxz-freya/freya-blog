## Introduction

**Toll Management System** is a large-scale highway tolling platform that I led during my role as a **Front-End Engineer**. The system integrates with the **BeiDou navigation system** to cross-verify real-time vehicle trajectories with tolling data, ensuring accurate billing and efficient operations.
Deployed in multiple cities, the platform has significantly improved tolling accuracy and highway management efficiency.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** Vue 3 (Composition API), JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- **Data Visualization:** ECharts 5 + Vue-ECharts
- **Map Services:** AMap + Custom BeiDou Coordinate Transformation Layer
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSocket

## Core Features

- **Real-Time Vehicle Monitoring:** WebSocket-based live tracking with **second-level updates**, supporting visualization of thousands of vehicles simultaneously.
- **Intelligent Alert System:** Custom rule engine to detect anomalies such as **missing tolls, route deviations, and payment mismatches**, with multi-format alerts (sound, pop-ups, push notifications).
- **Visualization Dashboards:** Multi-dimensional dashboards for traffic statistics, anomaly heatmaps, and revenue analysis to support operational decision-making.

## Highlights

- **Advanced Frontend Architecture:** Built a reactive data flow with Vue 3 Composition API for efficient state management and reusable components. Designed a consistent **visual style guide** (color system, typography, motion).
- **Performance Optimization:** Achieved smooth rendering of **millions of records** using pagination, virtual scrolling, and Web Workers for background data processing.
- **End-to-End Project Leadership:** Directed frontend technical design, API contract definitions, and **contract-first workflows**, boosting cross-team efficiency.
- **Engineering & Deployment:** Established coding standards, implemented CI/CD pipelines, and delivered a **full development-to-production deployment workflow**.

## Outcomes

- Successfully deployed in multiple regions, **improving tolling accuracy and operational efficiency**.
- Proven **high-concurrency, low-latency** architecture under real-world production traffic.
- Demonstrated **comprehensive expertise** across frontend engineering, UI/UX design, and cross-team collaboration.
