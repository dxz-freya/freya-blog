## Introduction

The **Beidou High-Precision Monitoring System** is an intelligent highway monitoring platform built on **Beidou navigation technology**. I independently led the **front-end architecture, technical implementation, and production deployment**.
The system provides comprehensive monitoring and early warning through high-precision vehicle trajectory tracking and real-time traffic analysis. Currently deployed across multiple provinces, it processes **over 5 million vehicle trajectory records daily**, significantly improving road safety and traffic efficiency.

## Technology Stack

- **Core Technologies:** Vue 3, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Map Services:** AMap (Gaode Maps API) + Custom Beidou Coordinate Transformation Module
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSocket
- **Data Visualization:** ECharts 5
- **Other Tools:** WebGL, Pinia, Vite, Web Workers, CI/CD

## Core Features

- **High-Precision Vehicle Monitoring:** Established a real-time WebSocket channel for **second-level updates**, supporting rendering and interaction of tens of thousands of vehicle points smoothly.
- **Data Aggregation & Analysis:** Built a **heatmap analytics system** to identify accident hotspots and congestion-prone segments; implemented **historical data replay** for multi-timeframe comparisons.
- **Real-Time Traffic Dashboard:** Designed a professional-grade monitoring dashboard supporting **4K/8K ultra-HD display**, with multi-layer management for roads, vehicles, and alerts.

## Highlights

- **Deep Frontend Architecture Expertise:** Built a **reactive architecture** with Vue 3 Composition API, enabling efficient state management and component reuse; integrated **WebGL** for high-performance rendering of large-scale trajectories.
- **Professional Visualization Design:** Delivered smooth interactive animations, multi-theme support for varying light conditions, and intuitive UX tailored for highway control centers.
- **Extreme Performance Optimization:** Implemented **data sharding and incremental loading**, achieving **smooth visualization of millions of data points** without UI lag.
- **Full Project Delivery:** Led **API contract design** for seamless backend integration; established automated testing pipelines with **85%+ unit test coverage**; delivered CI/CD for stable production deployment.

## Outcomes

- **Real-world deployment across multiple provinces**, processing 5M+ trajectory records daily with proven stability.
- Significantly **improved highway safety and traffic management efficiency** through accurate monitoring and anomaly detection.
- Demonstrated **end-to-end ownership** of a large-scale frontend system, from architecture and engineering practices to deployment and performance optimization.
