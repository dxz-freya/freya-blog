I’m Freya, a front-end developer with 4 years of hands-on experience and a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Fairleigh Dickinson University (2025).

During my career, I have led the end-to-end development and launch of large-scale front-end projects, gaining strong expertise in complex engineering collaboration and product delivery.

At FDU, I achieved a 3.8/4.0 GPA while expanding my skills into full-stack development, building a solid foundation from low-level systems to high-level applications.

**Key Skills:**

- **Programming Languages:** Proficient in JavaScript, Java, and Python; familiar with Shell scripting
- **Front-End Frameworks:** Extensive experience with React and Vue
- **Core Computer Science:** Strong background in databases, operating systems, software engineering, and algorithms
- **Application Development:** Practical experience in advanced app development, internet programming, system programming, and game programming

I believe code is the bridge between ideas and reality. I am passionate about building high-quality products and strive for elegant and efficient solutions.

Beyond technical skills, I am a collaborative and approachable teammate who values open communication and enjoys supporting others. I thrive in team environments where knowledge-sharing and problem-solving drive success.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking in nature and playing badminton, where every challenge gives me a sense of achievement and balance.
